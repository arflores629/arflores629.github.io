I'm a first-year computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part 2 
This was my first favorite lab because it was interesting to see the program calculate the current time until your birthday. I was able to write strings for the first time that called various functions based on their commands. I also wrote multiple functions that interacted with the strings to operate the code as stated in the function.

* Lab 6, part 2
My second favorite lab because I got to learn how to properly play Blackjack. It was a challenging program at first, since the functions needed to be set up in a specific way. But I learned how to evaluate whether a statement was true or false, and how to compare given values in order for the game to work.

* Lab 10, part 1
My last favorite would be this one because it was interesting to see information about counties when input into the command line. I learned how to call a file in the code and pull out information from the designated columns. It also provided a learning opportunity to see the population and representation of the state.
